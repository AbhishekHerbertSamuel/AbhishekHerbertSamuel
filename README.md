### 🚀 Projects
#### 🌐 [OpenRewrite – Open Source Contribution](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-static-analysis/pull/598/commits/05d35c28fe096b9d71e00d00a0a68f367a3c21d7)
• Resolved a critical ClassCastException by extending support for nested exception types (J.FieldAccess) in OpenRewrite’s Java refactoring engine.

• Enhanced the CombineSemanticallyEqualCatchBlocks module to safely merge catch blocks with identical logic, thus ensuring 100% unit test coverage across 30+ edge cases.

#### 🌐 [Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) - Open Source Contribution](https://github.com/onnx/ir-py/commit/d8fa01187999728fcf1b44b6db9c78f5db994f87)
• Developed a graph optimization pass in ONNX's Intermediate Representation repository that deduplicates model weights, thus reducing model size by up to 30%.

• Achieved this by eliminating redundant tensors via dtype, shape and content hashing, thus ensuring thorough unit test coverage across diverse edge cases.

#### 🏜️ [The Nest – Android Application](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D5SqWgR-jVtWdPRtA9yY2Al0yCZi1MGd/view?usp=sharing) | [Hardware + ML Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1smfn5dvDuSpqYY7pDWM8W3WxB1CQm5bB/view?usp=sharing)

• Built an Android-based infant monitoring system to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by detecting unsafe sleep postures and tracking environmental vitals.

• Achieved this by training a custom MobileNetV2 model on over 2000 images (99.32% accuracy).

• Deployed the quantized model (3 MB) on a Raspberry Pi, enabling low-cost edge inference with real-time alerts.

#### 📰 [Veritas Aequitas](https://github.com/AbhishekHerbertSamuel/Veritas-Aequitas---A-Fake-News-Detection-System-for-the-21st-century)
• Built a fake news detector using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes (94% accuracy) on 44K+ samples to combat misinformation.

• Serialized the model with Pickle and integrated real-time inference into the Flask-based web application.

• Containerized the application with Docker and deployed it via Render for CI/CD.
