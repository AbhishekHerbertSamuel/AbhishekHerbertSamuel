### 🌟 About Me
I am a B. Tech graduate from Shiv Nadar University, Chennai's founding batch (Class of 2025) with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (Internet of Things).

The world of technology with its infinite possibilities has always fascinated me. I enjoy tinkering with computers and am currently exploring Full-Stack Development, Machine Learning, Generative AI, Data Science, Data Analytics and IoT.

Community-oriented leadership is something that I am passionate about. This passion led me to serve as the Co-Founder and Club Representative of my alma mater's Business Club for nearly 4 years, where I learnt the art of fundraising, marketing and running a large scale event end to end.

I have also served as my class's Founding Class Representative and represented my university as a Student Ambassador and NSS Volunteer.

In addition to these pursuits, I am a trained western classical vocalist, pianist and an award-winning orator.

I strive to learn and grow everyday and am always curious and hungry for knowledge.
