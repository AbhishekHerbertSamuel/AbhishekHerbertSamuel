### 🌟 About Me
I am a B. Tech graduate from Shiv Nadar University, Chennai's founding batch (Class of 2025) with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering (Internet of Things).

The world of technology with its infinite possibilities has always fascinated me. I enjoy tinkering with computers and am currently exploring Full-Stack Development, Machine Learning, Generative AI, Data Science, Data Analytics and IoT.

Community-oriented leadership is something that I am passionate about. This passion led me to serve as the Co-Founder and Club Representative of my alma mater's Business Club for nearly 4 years, where I learnt the art of fundraising, marketing and running a large scale event end to end.

I have also served as my class's Founding Class Representative and represented my university as a Student Ambassador and NSS Volunteer.

In addition to these pursuits, I am a trained western classical vocalist, pianist and an award-winning orator.

I strive to learn and grow everyday and am always curious and hungry for knowledge.

### 🚀 Projects

#### 🌐 [Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) - Open Source Contribution](https://github.com/onnx/ir-py/blob/main/src/onnx_ir/passes/common/initializer_deduplication.py)
• Developed a graph optimization pass in ONNX's Intermediate Representation repository that deduplicates model weights, thus reducing model size by up to 30%.
• Achieved this by eliminating redundant tensors via dtype, shape and content hashing, thus ensuring thorough unit test coverage across diverse edge cases.

#### 🏜️ [The Nest](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D5SqWgR-jVtWdPRtA9yY2Al0yCZi1MGd/view?usp=sharing)
• Built an Android-based infant monitoring system to reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by detecting unsafe sleep postures and tracking environmental vitals.
• Achieved this by training a custom MobileNetV2 model on over 2000 images (99.32% accuracy).
• Deployed the quantized model (3 MB) on a Raspberry Pi, enabling low-cost edge inference with real-time alerts.

#### 📰 [Veritas Aequitas](https://github.com/AbhishekHerbertSamuel/Veritas-Aequitas---A-Fake-News-Detection-System-for-the-21st-century)
• Built a fake news detector using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes (94% accuracy) on 44K+ samples to combat misinformation.
• Serialized the model with Pickle and integrated real-time inference into the Flask-based web application.
• Containerized the application with Docker and deployed it via Render for CI/CD.
